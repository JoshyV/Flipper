	Many of you would expect that I copy and paste the game. And thats <strong>No no</strong>I have put alot of effort on this game. I am not claiming the game as is bescause its almost same as <strong>Flappy bird</strong>. So it wouldn't be same soon i'll add alot of things like shop,options,leaderboard and more. For us not to Worry just calm down.
	But Soon i'll add more things that would improve/upgrade the game.</h4>
